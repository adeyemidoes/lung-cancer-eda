# Uncovering Lung Cancer Mortality with Excel: A 890,000-Record EDA
Lung cancer is one of the most common and deadly diseases in the world. As part of building my data analytics portfolio, I explored a public dataset of 890,000 patient records to uncover trends in survival, treatment, and risk factors like age, smoking, and BMI, all using Microsoft Excel.

Iâ€™ll walk through how I cleaned and analyzed the data, the key insights I discovered, and how I designed an interactive dashboard to make the findings easier to interpret.

## About the Dataset
I used the [Lung Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khwaishsaxena/lung-cancer-dataset) from Kaggle, which includes 890,000 rows with features like:

* Gender
* Smoking status
* Age
* Treatment type
* BMI
* Country
* Survival status

This made it perfect for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project.

## Data Preparation in Excel

After downloading the dataset from Kaggle, I used the ETL process to get it ready for visualization. I loaded it into Excel using **Power Query** and started my calculations / insights preparation with Pivot Tables. KPIs displayed:

* Total patients diagnosed
* Survial of patients (%)
* Deaths in patients (%)
* BMI correlation to Lung Cancer
* Prevalent treament type being opted for
* Geographical visual of patient
* Age group with highest diagnoses

## Conclusion / Key Takeaways
Excel is more powerful than it gets credit for, with simple tools like PivotTables and thoughtful layout, I was able to uncover valuable patterns in a huge medical dataset.

ðŸ“Š This project taught me how to structure an EDA, present findings visually, and tell a story with data.
